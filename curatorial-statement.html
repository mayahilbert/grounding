      <p>
        Grounding&mdash;through dreaming, through connecting, through
        consciousness of place&mdash;is a much-needed practice today. Among
        other things, grounding rests us, and resting&mdash;letting the sun set
        and the city sleep&mdash;has become an act of defiance against the
        global systematic exploitation of self, time, and nature that fuels
        modernization.<sup>1</sup> Every moment and resource is currency, and
        grounding yourself removes you from circulation: an unproductive,
        inefficient move. There are so many things you could be doing, but your
        time is unaccounted for, and in this way, you escape the system and
        become your own again&mdash;for a while.While taking yourself out of
        economic circulation, grounding also enters other circulations&mdash;in
        the paths of dreamspaces, in the rhythm of heartbeats, in the exchange
        of energy, and in the flow of time. These groundings are our escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        The works in <em>Grounding </em>explore techniques for our escape. Sleep
        and slip into a dream, out of focus and control: wandering into the

        Tether a balloon to the ground and give it gravity. Route wires into the
        ground and discharge their negativity. Grow a garden, partake, enjoy,
        and then return it to the ground. At a time that feels so charged up, we
        offer Grounding&mdash;the grounding process releases an excess
        charge&mdash;and we are Grounding&mdash;we are conductive bodies, and as
        conductive bodies, we are like the earth.

        For Jonathan Crary sleep remains "an uncompromising interruption of the
        theft of time from us by capitalism." Under conditions Crary has
        described as 24/7 capitalism, Tricia Hersey has proclaimed, "Rest is

        <a href="dreams.html"><em>Dreams 梦境素描</em></a> by Carrie Chen
        archives dreamscapes in moving images, immortalizing the ephemeral
        spaces that appear between sleeping and waking. Chen describes the
        ongoing series as &ldquo;attempts to recall emotions such as confusion,
        nostalgia, dislocation, and excitement.&rdquo; These recollections
        materialize through 3D renderings that feel startlingly present, more a
        neighboring reality than a fleeting impression. The dreams reach into
        the subconscious and mold the abstract into the tangible: bubbles you
        could reach out and pop, falling paper cranes you can feel on your face.
        The variety in style and subject matter makes the viewer acutely aware
        of the vastness of this universe, a strange other-world with unknown
        laws of nature that we have been invited to preview. In Chen&rsquo;s
        grounding, she listens to her subconscious mind as an archivist
        preserving history and shares the recordings with the waking world.

        Dominika Jezewska harnesses artist block and uses it as a tool to create
        art without limits in
        <a href="a-year-of-dreaming.html"><em>A Year of Dreaming</em></a
        >. Through virtual reality and image manipulation, Jezewska produced a
        visual work every single day for a year, each one a deployment of
        creative production into a battle against expectations. The days are
        both iterative, sharing a language of crisp lines, airy colors, and
        recurring visual stories, and individual, each a glimpse into a unique
        world. They come together in a tapestry of raw artistic intention and
        open exploration. With no stretching timeline or larger plan,
        <em>A Year of Dreaming</em> takes one step at a time, grounding in the
        now and the self.

        The visual poem <a href="here-we-are.html"><em>Here We Are</em></a> by
        Sophie Capshaw-Mack highlights the way consciousness ebbs and flows
        through Earth and everything present in it. The poem begins with
        &ldquo;plants and machines, glowing, conscious like the
        algorithms&rdquo; and continues on to weave the physical world we live
        in with the intangible world we surround ourselves with, inviting us
        into a dream-like state of grounding. Wordplays draw lines between
        natural phenomena and human creations, such as between clouds in the sky
        and cloud computing. Accompanying Capshaw-Mack&rsquo;s handwritten poem
        is personal footage and kaleidoscopic graphics that amplify the
        relationship between ourselves and the worlds our mind takes us to.
        <em>Here We Are</em> opens up the possibility of grounding as a
        reciprocal relationship: we connect with the world, and the world
        connects with us.

      <p>
        Hayden Clay&rsquo;s
        <a href="human-nature.html"><em>Human Nature</em></a> explores how to
        ground ourselves to the earth through dreamscapes. What if we allowed
        ourselves to reconnect with nature by existing in the in-between? The
        series utilizes hyper realistic 3D renderings to amplify the sensations
        of being within nature to the extent we become one with it, the
        boundaries between the human body and natural bodies blurring as we feel
        the rooting grass and the flowing water. There is a sigh of relief in
        becoming one with the Earth, as though this entire time our bodies have
        been straining to maintain an artificial barrier.
        <em>Human Nature</em> invites us to lean into nature, grounding in a
        state that is more vast and quiet than we can know in our own body.

        Tabitha Soren&rsquo;s
        <a href="surface-tension.html"><em>Surface Tension</em></a> explores the
        intersection between the primal humanity within our skin and the
        expansive domain behind our screens. The encounter between our warm,
        tangible bodies and the cold, boundless digital realm is illuminated
        against photos pulled off the web. We swipe over a wildfire, tap through
        an ocean, and pinch into a vigil: our daily connections to the world
        around us available at our fingertips. The surface of our screens is a
        meeting place where we seek community and news; but the remnants of this
        interaction, left as smears and prints upon the screen, show a dubious
        connection that is one-sided and desperate in its grimy accumulation.
        <em>Surface Tension </em>brings us back to our bodies by exposing the
        surfaces of digital interactions.

        Jose Daniel Benitez and Puck de Haan explore the relationship between
        the human body and the digital world in
        <a href="joseexe.html"><em>Jose.exe</em></a
        >. A 3D scan of Jose&rsquo;s body is given the ground he&rsquo;s scanned
        in with, but left afloat in space. In a space that crosses fluidly
        between two and three dimensions, the ground and sky are no longer
        defined. The uncertain surroundings and glitching scan question the
        reproducibility of art and, more personally, our sense of self, in the
        digital age. <em>Jose.exe</em> invites us to think about our virtual
        embodiment: how our bodies interact with and within the digital
        environment and our surroundings. Referencing Walter Benjamin's "The
        Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," Hito Steyerl&rsquo;s
        &ldquo;In Defense of the Poor Image,&rdquo; and posthuman theory,
        <em>Jose.exe</em> searches for a new ground for virtual bodies.

        In <a href="remediation.html"><em>Remediation</em></a> by Hayden Stern,
        music plays in the background as viewers watch the act of crocheting
        with white yarn. The hands, doubled through layering, belong to the
        artist:<em>
          &ldquo;Once I have reached my physical limit crocheting, I unravel the
          textile, leaving no evidence of my handiwork.&rdquo; </em
        >Stern explores the daily reality of a Disabled body through the
        intensive labor of moving through physical space, invisible when
        compared to the ease of others doing the same tasks. Handiwork like
        crochet can be a grounding activity: a practice for relaxation. Yet even
        this quiet practice of connecting mind, body, and surroundings is not
        effortless. Even this &ldquo;rest&rdquo; is labor seeped in the intent
        of production, and for many, there is no product: the labor of remaining
        physically present is endless. Hayden Stern&rsquo;s
        <em>Remediation </em>reminds viewers that grounding unwinds differently
        for everyone.

        <a href="cooling-off.html"><em>Cooling Off</em></a
        >, a series of illustrations by Malcolm Charles, explores themes of
        regulation, centeredness, and relationships. A flower, a man, and a bird
        burn through rain and wind. The flames are solitary and quiet,
        unaffected by the forces and figures around them: an aura of heat and
        light that persists in a cold, rainy park and in flight above the
        clouds. The three are marked, connected in their volatility, though
        alone in their environment. The series offers a space to meditate and
        let the fire burn.

        <a href="come-and-take-a-seat.html"><em>Come and Take a Seat</em></a>
        looks at moments of transition and connection: dichotomies of human and
        environment, movement and stillness, monochrome and color coming
        together in the randomized pairing of images from one photo series
        featuring walking figures and another featuring chairs in public spaces.
        Every empty chair is an anchoring opportunity, offering time for
        self-reflection, time for perspective, time without the expectation of
        moving forward. Every person is on a journey, with their own origin and
        destination and pauses along the way. These moments of sitting are
        punctuation in their journey, moments when they ponder what came before
        and await what will come after. <em>Come and Take a Seat </em>is a
        polite invitation to slow down, take a respite from going to and from,
        and reflect upon these journeys.

        <a href="sweet-spot.html"><em>Sweet Spot</em></a> by Jillian McDonald
        provides an intimate view of the relationship between humans and plants.
        Unfiltered, she strokes the moss with the care you would a friend or
        partner. Grounded in a tender, one-on-one human-to-plant relationship,
        the piece calls into question the expansively impersonal relationship of
        humanity to the natural world around us. This serial interspecies caress
        contrasts the lack of attention most give to nature day to day with an
        ecosexual approach to a nature walk, caring for the earth with the
        tenderness of a lover as opposed to the expectations of a mother.

        Niceley seeks grounding in urban greenery in
        <a href="the-bronx-is-the-greenest-borough.html"
          ><em>The Bronx is the Greenest Borough</em></a
        >, a video and mixed media piece that takes viewers on a train ride to
        search for nature in the Bronx. As a Bronx resident, Niceley was
        inspired to create this piece after the discovery that despite living in
        what has been titled &ldquo;New York City&rsquo;s Greenest
        Borough,&rdquo; sightings of greenery are rare in daily life. Thus,
        Niceley documents the green she sees from a train car as a window into
        the actual access of residents.
        <em>The Bronx is the Greenest Borough</em> mixed media accompaniment
        shows an alternate train window, one fully blanketed in leaves with all
        human presence and functionality obscured: a Bronx consumed by green.
        These striking moving visuals and textures come together with an
        immersive musical component to bring us into the grounding experience of
        a Bronxonian.

        utilizes years of data from the Department of Sanitation to produce a
        24-minute bass music composition. By developing and overlapping eight
        scores that reflect the changing state of the environment, they
        establish a connection between the scale of time in nature and human
        existence. Grounding oneself in an area known for deteriorating the
        Earth, an area that was once the largest municipal dump in the world, is
        an acceptance and mourning of the lasting impacts of global
        overproduction. The reversal of the landfill to a natural space attempts
        to reground the space and reverse time, but it is an imperfect reversal:
        this nature will be man-made and built upon a history of abuse.

        <a href="teaching-capitalism-to-nature.html"
          ><em>Teaching Capitalism to Nature</em></a
        >, Clint Sleeper follows a man reading full-length capitalism classics
        to unimpressed landscapes, with the tongue-in-cheek mindset of,
        &ldquo;Perhaps if we could teach our environment about the prosperity of
        a capitalist model, then nature might surrender its unreasonable
        demands, which have up to this point, inhibited economic growth.&rdquo;
        Through continuous wind, snow, and muffled mics, Sleeper puts the
        hyper-production of the industrialized world in stark contrast to the
        ground itself and all it naturally encompasses. &ldquo;The Wealth of
        Nations&rdquo; labors and deforests, destroying the earth to fuel
        industrial expansion&mdash;and thus our opportunity to find peace,
        solitude, and grounding within it dwindles. Will nature ever surrender
        to our unreasonable demands or will we instead learn to be grounded in
        its peace?

        explores the value of data and its cost, both for humanity and the
        natural world. The cloud seems like a distant, indistinct place, evoking
        summer skies, drifting and aimless. The metaphor encourages our mind to
        slide over the internal workings, a magical black box of information.
        Our data goes into the cloud, and out of our minds.
        <em>The Cloud Rendered in Water &amp; Blood</em> reaches into this fog
        and grounds the cloud in the buildings, the servers, the cables, and the
        bodies that maintain it, demystifying the information that people and
        organizations produce and consume using this infrastructure. Gathering
        this data, storing it, and dispensing it is a resource-intensive
        process, all in an attempt to control information, and through
        information, us.&nbsp;
