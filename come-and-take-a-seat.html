          <em>Come and Take a Seat</em> is a project about perspective and
          everyday life. It’s composed of two visually disjoined photography
          series. The first one in black and white shows universalized figures
          of people walking alone through public spaces – it references the
          “come” in the title. The other series is focused on pictures of empty
          chairs outdoors – it’s a visual invitation to “take a seat”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Connecting photos from both series can serve as a way of
          deconstructing daily life into periods of sitting and walking, which
          are one of the most elemental actions one can take. It’s an
          encouragement to focus on simplicity and a visual riddle: Who is going
          to sit where? Where are they coming from? Where are they coming to?
          Why? One thing is for certain - everyone walking will eventually take
          a seat and everyone sitting will eventually walk.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way <em>Come and Take a Seat</em> proposes a new perspective
          where time is not being measured in seconds, but rather in chairs. By
          interacting with this project one can visualize and examine multitudes
          of perspectives and find new meanings in everyday life. It’s a
          celebration of a timeless notion of taking a seat.

        <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
        <p>
          Mateusz Gawrysiak is an artist from Poland. In his practice he builds
          upon his past experiences and his desire for a better world. He works
          mainly with photography - in a collaborative and documentary way. When
          he is taking photos of a group of people he takes time to become a
          part of them. Community building and organic collaborations are
          important to him. Another area of interest is the interaction with the
          viewer - how to make a positive impact with art at all the stages of
          the process?
