          <em>Teaching Capitalism to Nature</em> draws on political philosophers
          including Slavoj Žižek, Simon Critchley, and Mikhail Bakhtin toward
          the creation of a boring pedagogue character, immersed in a
          disinterested text, and unaffected by the sublime landscape in which
          he finds himself. The humorous juxtaposition of the pedagogue and the
          scenery is just as significant as the structure of the work, focused
          on experimentation with the one-liner format, where the title of the
          work is the punchline to the set-up: what could be more fruitless than
          asking our capitalists to care for the environment? Effectively, the
          resulting creative exploration is a one-liner on repeat (for more than
          20 hours).
