          <em>Post-Natural Pastorale</em> is a sound/video installation that
          explores the relationship between human and environmental
          temporalities in a time of climate crisis. The project takes as its
          starting point New York City's Freshkills, once known as Fresh Kills
          Landfill, the largest municipal dump in the world. Currently in the
          process of a decades-long transformation into a public park,
          Freshkills is a uniquely liminal space, where our long-term effects on
          the Earth are palpable. The installation emerges from the
          multitemporal dynamics of this environment—the thousand-year decay of
          a Styrofoam cup, the multigenerational use of the land by humans, the
          seasonal cycle of the regenerating vegetation, and the gathering of
          clouds. Each of these temporal layers is translated into musical
          notation using municipal and public data, including statistical
          projections of weather patterns and methane and leachate emissions
          data from the Department of Sanitation. The resulting eight scores are
          played by double bassist Robert Black (Bang on a Can All-Stars), whose
          performances are filmed and later projected onto a labyrinth of
          screens in an installation space. When heard simultaneously, these
          performances create a soundscape of data that coalesces multiple
          temporalities into one immersive experience.Supported by The Robert
          Black Foundation and the Scholarship Facilitation Fund (UConn Office
          of the Vice President for Research). Selected by Creative Capital On

          <strong>Knifeandfork (Brian House + Sue Huang)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2004, artists Brian House and Sue Huang have collaborated as
          Knifeandfork on projects that critically reframe contemporary media
          and technology. Culture guide Flavorpill writes, “the imaginative
          bicoastal duo‘s installations utilize unorthodox media, including text
          messages and video clips, in their expository repositioning of
          traditional art forms.” The artists have previously exhibited at
          national and international venues including the Museum of Contemporary
          Art (MOCA), Los Angeles; the Contemporary Arts Center (CAC),
          Cincinnati; Rhizome at the New Museum, New York; the Beall Center for
          Art + Technology, Irvine; Ars Electronica, Linz; and Kulturhuset,
          Stockholm, among others. They have received grant and commission
          funding from organization such as Rhizome; the James Irvine Foundation
          (MOCA, Los Angeles commission); and Creative Scotland (NEoN
          commission). They were selected as finalists for the Creative Capital
          Award in 2020 (On Our Radar). House (<a href="https://brianhouse.net"
