          <em>Jose.exe</em>, a captivating collaboration by artists Jose Daniel
          Benitez and Puck de Haan, intricately weaves Hito Steyerl's
          <em>Defense of the Poor Image</em>, Walter Benjamin's
          <em>Exploration of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</em>,
          Katherine Hayles' posthumanism, and the <em>Grounding</em> exhibition
          theme from New Media Artspace, Baruch College.
        </p>
        <p>
          The artwork aims to ground the human body in the realm of computation,
          transcending individualism by transforming Jose's body into a
          posthuman digital form, fostering seamless interaction with
          intelligent machines. Steyerl's concept of the poor image finds
          resonance as the 3D scan of Jose's body effortlessly circulates within
          the digital landscape while challenging conventional notions of
          authenticity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walter Benjamin's insights enrich the artwork's understanding by
          exploring the transformative power of context, altering the interplay
          between the digital body and its surroundings. Within the
          <em>'Grounding</em> exhibition, <em>Jose.exe</em> prompts reflection
          on embodiment, mindfulness, and technology's impact on our present
          moment, inviting viewers to reconsider their connection with the
          digital world. <em>Jose.exe</em> integrates diverse themes, inviting
          critical engagement and reimagining artistic expression within the
          ever-evolving digital realm.

        <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
        <p>
          Jose Daniel Benitez (he, him, they, them) is a multimedia artist,
          activist, holds a graphic communications bachelor of art from Baruch
          College-CUNY, and is currently pursuing a master in media studies from
          The New School University. His work spans from participatory art,
          video installations, photography, and silkscreen printing, that
          explores the intersectionality of identity and struggles in movement
          spaces. He is well known for being a core member of Mobile Print Power
          (MPP), a political silk screen printing collective, and for being a
          member-leader at Centro Corona. Majority of his works are created
          through a participatory or collaborative process based on the
          political principle of believing in the power of collaborative and
          collective work in movement spaces.

          Puck de Haan, a motion designer, is driven by a deep passion for art
          that communicates emotions, challenges perspectives, and stimulates
          the mind. As their journey evolves, Puck's focus has shifted towards
          moving visuals, installation, and projection. Currently exploring
          Europe, embracing life's peculiarities, devouring books, and
          connecting with fascinating individuals, Puck remains a perpetual
          learner. Having completed studies in Animation, Puck now delves into
          Image and Media Technology at HKU in Utrecht (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±) and HfG Media Art in
          Karlsruhe (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª). This creative exploration encompasses motion design,
          experimental film, photography, new technologies, spatial
          interactivity, and the intricacies of perception. Poetry, language,
          cinema, technology, and travel continue to shape Puck's artistic
          journey, pushing boundaries, making bold choices, and above all,
          finding joy along the way.
