          “The Bronx is New York City’s greenest borough —24% of the borough is
          considered parkland —yet environmentalists say that much of its green
          space is consolidated in large parks on the periphery of the borough,
          which are difficult to access for many residents." <br /><small

        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the theme of "grounding" I consider my condition as a
          Bronx resident who has to "hustle" and confront more concrete than
          green on a daily basis. The irony for which I live in the greenest
          borough yet may not easily access green sheds light on inequities that
          I continually address through my artistic practice. This film entails
          my "search for green" in the Bronx, offering a virtual reality
          experience of a Bronxonian. This is how we find grounding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coupled with the film I offer a three-dimensional mixed media painting
          which refers to stills of the film. As it renders a likeness of leaves
          growing out of a train car, it mirrors the imagery of the film but
          also conveys its own sense of “overgrowth.” Tension is felt as the
          beauty of the overgrowth indicates the absence of humans and the
          intentional use of the car. I feel this piece refers to the tenuous
          relationship between mankind and nature, reflected in climate crises.
          This image is of a post human moment. Whether or not we can coexist,
          it is grounding to know the earth will ultimately heal itself.

        <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
        <p>
          Niceley's work emphasizes a spirit of expression, collectivism, and
          justice. Often exploring themes of feminism and race, loss and 
          nostalgia, she employs a wide range of media to redefine portraiture
          across dimensions  and states of being.  She draws much of her
          inspiration from the common human experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent works she emphasizes the politics of identity through the
          incorporation of found collage elements from media and revelations of
          personal experiences in repurposed photographs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Placed within vivid color fields, the subjects are given emotional
          context. The moods of the works range from “heated” to subdued.
          Tension is felt as Niceley harmonizes elements of beauty and pain,
          inviting the viewer to engage with as well as project historical and
          personal narratives reflected in the works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fundamentally, these pieces focus on pain and rage. Through memorial
          and celebration the artist elevates the oppressed—the marginalized—the
          survivors, thereby creating a greater sense of peace in the creator,
          and hopefully in the viewer.
