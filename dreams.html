          <em>Dreams 梦境素描</em> is an ongoing series of moving images created
          by Carrie Chen since 2019. Works in this series engage with the
          practice of archiving dreamscapes and materializing subconscious
          phenomenological experiences through 3D modeling, texturing, and
          animation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each moving image was created from subconscious impressions and
          memories of spaces that have appeared during dream states. Based on
          quick notes and sketches upon awakening, the spaces visualized range
          in scale and context— from cellular forms in the female anatomy to
          alien landscapes. Each work attempts to recall memories of emotion
          within dream spaces such as confusion, nostalgia, dislocation, and
          excitement.
