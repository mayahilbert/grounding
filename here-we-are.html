          <em>Here We Are</em> (2023) is a mesmerizing visual poem that embraces
          the captivating notion of panpsychism, a profound philosophical belief
          that awareness permeates every aspect of existence, no matter how
          subtle. Departing from dualism or physicalism theories of
          consciousness, panpsychism suggests that the very fabric of reality is
          infused with awareness in varying degrees. Through an evocative
          exploration of the profound interconnection between all entities,
          <em>Here We Are</em> blurs the boundaries between material and
          ethereal dimensions. The film invites viewers to ponder the intricate
          relationships between the real and the imagined, provoking
          contemplation on the underlying nature of existence itself. By
          investigating the notion of universal awareness,
          <em>Here We Are</em> prompts reflection on the profound way in which
          technology can facilitate disembodiment and unified consciousness.

        <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
        <p>
          Sophie Capshaw-Mack is an experimental new media artist investigating
          the nature of consciousness. She imagines vibrant technicolor
          dreamscapes as a means of exploring the mysteries of the mind and its
          intricate connection to physical reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sophieâ€™s art practice involves fusing technology with conventional
          artistic methods, thus synthesizing tangible elements of creative
          expression with intangible modes of production. Through her artwork,
          she aims to blur the distinction between material and ethereal
          dimensions while cultivating a sense of empathy and compassion across
          diverse forms of intelligence and existence. Her exploration into
          consciousness is deeply inspired by her lived experiences as a
          disabled and neurodivergent artist.
